Hi, I'm *Danny*! I'm a web developer who lives in *New York City* and works full-time as a front end web developer for *Byte Dept.*

I have been working with the Web since the year *2000*, back when we stressed about web safe colors and threw around the term 'DHTML.' When I'm not building slick things for the web, you can find me xxxxxxx.

Once upon a time, I was labeled a Genius at an awesome company named Apple. I was geared towards understanding other humans and fixing things, two things that I love to do! Some of the problems I solved weren't limited to just hardware, I built software to make working in an Apple Store easier.

All of this happened in my home town near Miami, Florida. Yes, I left sunny Miami for busy New York. For years, programming has felt to me as my not-so-secret super power!

If you are interested in the stuff I do and want to read more, check out my [résumé](/resume/). You should also check out some projects I've put time into, like these below!
