Hello! I'm *Daniel*, a web developer who works full-time at *Condé Nast.*

I have been building for the Web for many years now, as far back as when we were crippled to only using web-safe colors.

*New York City* is where I live, and I am originally from *Florida*. Writing software is a huge part of my life, and I would not have it any other way.

Consider giving my [résumé](/resume/) a read if you are interested in learning more about my past.
