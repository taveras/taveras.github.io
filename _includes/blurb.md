Hi, I'm *Daniel*, a web developer who works full-time at *Condé Nast.*

I have been making stuff on the Web as far back as when we were crippled by web safe colors, and we sang chants chock-full of acronyms such as 'DHTML.'

*New York City* is where I live, and *Florida* is where I was raised. Writing software is a huge part of my life, and I would not have it any other way.

Consider giving my [résumé](/resume/) a read if you are interested in learning more about my past.
