Hi, I'm *Danny*, a web developer who lives in *New York City* and works full-time as a front end web developer at a company named *Byte Dept.*

I have been working with the Web since the year *2000*, back when we stressed about web safe colors and threw around the terms like 'DHTML.' When I'm not building slick things for the web, you can probably find me retrogaming. I love 8-bit graphics!

Once upon a time, I was working as a Genius at Apple. Repairing computers was fun, but building software to improve the life at an Apple Store was awesome!

I grew up in Hollywood, Florida, which is not too far from Miami (depending on who you ask.) Writing code has been a large part of my life for many years now, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

If you are interested in details about what I have been involved in, check out my [résumé](/resume/). Below you'll find some projects I've found joy in working on. Enjoy!
