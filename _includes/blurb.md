Hi, I'm *Danny*, a web developer who works full-time at an agency named *Byte Dept.*

I have been building for the Web since the year *2000*, back when we stressed about web safe colors and threw around the terms like 'DHTML.' When I'm not making slick stuff, you can probably find me repairing old Macs, or playing retro video games!

I grew up in *Florida* and then moved to *New York City* some years ago. Writing code has been a large part of my life for many years now, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

If you are interested in learning more about me, consider giving my [résumé](/resume/) a read.

Currently my list of projects is private, but please reach out to me if you would like more information.
